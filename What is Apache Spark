What is Apache Spark :- 

Defination :-
    (i) Apache Spark is an Open Source Distributed Data Processing Engine written in Scala providing a unified API and 
        Distributed Data Sets to users for both batch and streaming processing.
    (ii) It is also a multi-language engine, that provides APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and libraries for several programming 
         languages like Java, Scala, Python, and R, allowing developers to work with Spark using the language they are most comfortable with.
          a. Scala: Spark’s primary and native language is Scala. Many of Spark’s core components are written in Scala, and it provides the 
                    most extensive API for Spark.
          b. Java: Spark provides a Java API that allows developers to use Spark within Java applications. Java developers can access most 
                   of Spark’s functionality through this API.
          c. Python: Spark offers a Python API, called PySpark, which is popular among data scientists and developers who prefer Python for 
                     data analysis and machine learning tasks. PySpark provides a Pythonic way to interact with Spark.
          d. R: Spark also offers an R API, enabling R users to work with Spark data and perform distributed data analysis using their 
                familiar R language.
